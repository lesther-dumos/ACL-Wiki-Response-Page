        <h3>ACL Tears in Female Athletes: Q&A with a Sports Medicine Expert</h3>
        <p>Females are more prone to ACL tears due to a combination of anatomical, hormonal, and biomechanical 
            factors. Women typically have a wider pelvis, which creates a different angle between the thigh 
            bone and shin bone, increasing stress on the ACL. Hormonal fluctuations, like estrogen, may affect 
            ligament laxity. Moreover, differences in muscle strength, neuromuscular control, and landing 
            mechanics can lead to increased injury risk in females. These multifaceted factors make women 
            more susceptible to ACL tears compared to males.</p>

        <h3>Rehabilitation Protocol for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction</h3>
        <p>General ACL recovery involves several key phases. Initially, patients focus on reducing pain and swelling.
            Subsequently, they work on regaining range of motion and strength through targeted exercises. As they 
            progress, functional activities and sports-specific training are integrated. Patience, consistency, 
            and adherence to a structured rehabilitation program are vital for successful recovery.</p>

        <h3>Torn Meniscus</h3>
        <p>Mincis, small muscle fibers in the knee, often tear when the ACL ruptures due to the sudden and 
            forceful movement of the knee. As the ACL provides stability to the joint, its rupture causes 
            instability, leading to the mincis getting stretched and sometimes torn in the process. This 
            contributes to knee pain and dysfunction.</p>
